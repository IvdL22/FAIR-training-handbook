## Description
Open science seeks to improve the sharing of a large body of knowledge on a wide scale.
To facilitate this, it is necessary that each element can be easily and unambiguously identified and retrieved. The solution is to assign each piece of information (training material, data, software, document, author etc.) a unique and permanent identifier (PID: Persistent Identifier). In this chapter we explore what this means in the context of FAIR and for training materials.


## Prerequisites
How you assign a unique identifier is influenced by where and how you share your training materials. It's recommended that you explore [Chapter 2: Structure materials for FAIRness](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_02/) and [Chapter 3: Getting ready to create your materials or reuse](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_03/) before starting on this chapter.
