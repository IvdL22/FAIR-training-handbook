## Description
In this chapter, we will present what is a persistent identifier (PID), and how to get one for your training material. This step is essential to achieve FAIR training material, being directly linked with Findability and Reuse. 
As a consequence of getting one PID visibility of your work can be enhanced, and the deposit that is associated works as a backup of your work handing over the maintenance to the nominated repository.

    **At the end of this chapter you should be able to:**
   
    Minimum

    1. Explain what a PID is and its importance for enabling and sharing training resources in the context of FAIR and open education and training.
    2. List and differentiate the types of PIDs that are relevant for publishing and sharing training materials.
    3. Assign an appropriate PID to your training materials .

    Recommended

    4. Get an author ID ORCID

## Prerequisites
In order to decide whether the best choice for you is having all the material under one identifier or organising a collection you need to know the structure of your material, where it is best stored, as well as thinking about collaborators and potential readers. Therefore it can be useful to read the [chapters 2- (Interoperable) Structure materials for FAIRness](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_02/) and [3- Getting ready to create your materials](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_03/).
