## Description
In this chapter, we will present what is a persistent identifier (PID), and how to get one for your training material. This step is essential to achieve FAIR training material, being directly linked with Findability and Reuse. 
As a consequence of getting one PID visibility of your work can be enhanced, and the deposit that is associated works as a backup of your work handing over the maintenance to the nominated repository.

## Prerequisites
In order to decide whether the best choice for you is having all the material under one identifier or organising a collection you need to know the structure of your material, where it is best stored, as well as thinking about collaborators and potential readers. Therefore it can be useful to read the [chapters 2- (Interoperable) Structure materials for FAIRness](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_02/) and [3- Getting ready to create your materials](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_03/).

## What is a Persistent Identifier (PID) and why should I use it for training materials?

Open science seeks to improve the sharing of a large body of knowledge on a wide scale.
To facilitate this, it is necessary that each element that will be shared can be easily and unambiguously identified and retrieved. The solution to this challenge is to assign each piece of information (training material, data, software, document, author etc.) a unique and permanent identifier (PID: Persistent Identifier).

_Imagine the following scenario_: if you go to the opera, you leave your coat in the cloakroom in exchange for a ticket. From that moment on, you don't have to worry about where your coat is stored. You enjoy the performance, knowing that your ticket allows you to get your coat back. This ticket carries a unique identifier (a number on the ticket) issued by a trusted third party (the wardrobe attendant) who undertakes to ensure that this number is unique and remains assigned to your coat.

As with the example about the coat, having a persistent identifier for training materials makes them easier to **find** amongst all the other materials in the same repository (i.e., the cloakroom). This, evermore, facilitates a long-lasting material accessibility working also as backup. Additionally, using PIDs for the authors makes it easier to identify and acknowledge the contribution of individuals to developing and maintaining the materials. This also makes the materials easier to cite when it comes to **reusing** them.

**The PIDs must comply with a few rules:**

* **Globally Unique:**

    To enable global uniqueness, a PID should comply with a **controlled syntax** to avoid clashes, for instance, by having **namespaces** that are **governed** by clearly defined **authorities**. (_the number of your ticket is unique, so you are sure you will get your coat back and not someone else’s_)
* **Persistent:** 

    The identifier, and the object to which it points, should be **maintained** for a **long period of time**.  The syntax used for the identifier should be also persistent (don’t change the way you label your tickets, don’t dispose of the coat during the opera)
* **Resolvable**: 

    The identifier allows both **human** and **machine** users to **access the resource** (_the ticket tells you where to get your coat back_). 

After understanding this, you must be asking: But in exactly what context of training should I worry about the PIDs? Let me help you with that! In the context of training, PIDs can be assigned to:

* Individual training materials (e.g., a set of slides, a training dataset)
* A collection of materials associated with a training event
* Authors of the materials.

In the following paragraphs it will be discussed how to get these PIDs for your training materials. A few examples of real-word (case studies) will help showing  approaches to giving PIDs to your  training materials.

## Types of PIDs Relevant for Training Materials

Although there are a number of different PID types that can be applied to objects and authors, the two which are most used for training materials will be discussed here. These are DOIs and ORCID.

### What is a DOI? 

If you want to share your training material with the rest of the world, we recommend using a  **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** (doi.org). DOIs are one of the most common PIDs used by public repositories. If you would like to learn more about the concept of DOIs  take a look at this [fact sheet](https://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOIKeyFacts.html).
DOI stands for Digital Object Identifier, and it is a **unique** and **persistent** identification of  objects (physical or digital) permanently! And as they are coupled with metadata, they can be modified over time to keep track of the locations and characteristics of the objects they identify, both for you and your users. You benefit from efficient management and accurate tracking, as well as gaining the ability to more easily automate processes and collaborate with partners in your community. DOI relies on a non-profit organisation that is the governance body of the federation of registration agencies. DOIs are generated automatically when you make your resources available in a repository such as dataverse and zenodo, or when a research article is published.
   
### What is an ORCID?

ORCID, which stands for Open Researcher and Contributor ID, is a global, non-profit organisation which provides a **unique**, **persistente** identifier free of charge to researchers. You might be a lucky one that never had to worry about having a unique name, but  if you are not, you know how important it is to identify homonyms!  It is extremely useful to ensure that you are correctly identified, worldwide. ORCID is a perfect solution to take homonymy into account, even more, the system allows you to add aliases on your profile to take care of any evolution of your name making sure that it will be tracked back to you.  Another good consequence, is that along a life of changes your ORCID will stay the same, despite any other personal information that might change, not just assuring to give you the deserved credits, but keeping trackability of your work.

You can see a bit more about it in the video bellow.

#### Get yourself an ORCID  

As you could see, PIDs for authors make it much easier to **FIND** materials written by a particular person, and  also makes it easier to ensure the credits for the right person.  The Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) is increasingly used by journals and funders to uniquely identify individuals. It is already a requirement at the NIH (National Institutes of Health), CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and more the 110 publishers. 
Therefore, it is a good option for authors of training materials as well.

## How does it work in the real word: Case Studies of Using PIDs in Training

Before diving into how to assign PIDs to the training materials, we would like to show you two examples of how organisations are approaching this in practice. 

### 1. Australian BioCommons
[Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) supports Australian life science communities by providing bioinformatics and bioscience data infrastructures, services and training. At Australian Biocommons we share training materials from our webinars and workshops via a dedicated [Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/australianbiocommons-training/). We chose to use Zenodo to share training materials because we don’t have a repository of our own and Zenodo has established ways of managing metadata, DOI and versioning. It is also widely used in the scientific community.

For each event, we create a Zenodo record ([see this example.](https://zenodo.org/record/6350808#.YkPhE25Bw3Q)) that includes detailed metadata, new training materials and links to previous materials that were reused as part of the training and that can be found in our Zenodo community.

We use two types of PIDs when sharing materials from our events.
* DOIs - Zenodo automatically assigns a DOI to the record for the event. We also use DOIs when linking to related materials to ensure that there is no ambiguity about which materials were used.
* ORCID - We use trainers’ ORCIDs to ensure that they get credit for the effort and to make it clear who participated in the event

### 2. CLARIN
[CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) is a digital research infrastructure offering data, tools, and services to support research based on language resources. Currently, the infrastructure does not have a centralised repository to store all the training and learning materials produced during the training events and workshops. 

A training event usually contains the following information: slides, handouts, video tutorials, language resources datasets and/or tools. The slides and handouts are frequently published on the event web page, while the recordings of the presentations are published on the CLARIN YouTube channel. On the other hand, the language resources and tools used during the training are stored in the CLARIN national repositories with a **unique** identifier, and can be cited.

One possible solution to have a PID assigned to all the materials used during one training event is to create a virtual collection in the CLARIN [Virtual Collection Registry](https://collections.clarin.eu/public?7). A virtual collection is a coherent set of links of digital objects that can be easily created, accessed and cited with the help of **DOIs**. The links can originate from different archives. Here is an example of a virtual collection created for a hands-on tutorial on transcribing interview data: http://hdl.handle.net/11372/VC-1033.

Other practices that the trainers in the CLARIN community have adopted are:
* Depositing the training materials together with the datasets in their CLARIN national data repository. See example: http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.11752/OPEN-537. The advantage of using this path is that the authors can add more extensive metadata to describe their materials.
* Depositing the training materials on Zenodo. See example: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5506969.  In this case, **related identifiers** have been included that lead to the main platform where the course has been developed and maintained.

## How to Get a DOI for your Training Materials

Before getting a PID for your training materials you need to think how you want to organise and how extensive it is. To help, ask yourself the following: 

<span style="color:white">_</span> | <span style="color:white">_</span> 
-- | --
OR |Do you want to get one PID for your whole training or course?
OR | If, for example, you have organised a one-week training or developed a MOOC course containing several topics, do you want to get a separate PID for each topic/module?
OR | You want to organise by concepts and create a mapped collection in which each concept will have an ID with dataset and metadata grouped

No answer is wrong, you just need to make sure that when you share the material all related data will be findable, accessible and reusable as much as possible. Keeping that in mind, you might want to find an strategy to help others reusing your training when the material is very extensive. For example, a full day or a full week training are composed not only of a presentation, but a description of sessions of this presentation, activities, videos, etc. So in this case, it could be handy to have a training splited in small sessions with individual IDs, shared later as a colection (see more about it in chapter **?**)

Example of a one-week training with one DOI: 

Example of a training with DOI assigned per module:

By far the easiest way to get a PID for your training materials is by sharing them in a public repository that assigns a PID on your behalf, see more about that in [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/identifiers.html) and, [chapter 2]https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_02/) and [chapter 3](https://elixir-fair-training.github.io/FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_03/).

For example, in the case studies you read earlier ,the Australian BioCommons shares their materials via Zenodo which automatically assigns a DOI to the materials. Similarly, the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry assigns a PID (either Handle or DOI) to materials added to a virtual collection. If you are sharing your materials via GitHub you also have the option to use Zenodo to archive your [repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).com and issue a DOI for the archive. 

In other hands, If you are maintaining your own repository of training materials, you will need to have a system in place for assigning and maintaining persistent identifiers. RDMkit provides guidance on the things you will need to consider when doing this.
