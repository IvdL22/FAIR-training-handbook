## Description

In this chapter we explain what the FAIR principles are, the importance of these principles and their increased adoption over the years, as well as the pros and cons of making training materials FAIR. We will give a brief history of FAIR data, and how these principles were extended and adapted to training materials. 

## Prerequisites

None, except the interest to continue reading further.

    **At the end of this chapter you should be able to:**

    1. Explain what FAIR means
    2. List the main pros and cons of FAIRifying training materials
    3. Determine whether a given type of training material can in principle be FAIRifyed
    4. Describe the difference between FAIR and Open
    5. Explain the difference between FAIRifying training materials vs FAIRifying data / software

## The FAIR Data principles in details 

A primary task in developing new training sessions is preparing training materials, which is time-consuming and challenging for both new and experienced trainers. Finding and (re)using existing materials is one solution to this problem. However, it requires that these have been shared, properly described, and made available for (re)use by their authors. Finding suitable online materials that arenâ€™t subject to licensing and/or copyright restrictions can be tricky. They are often scattered across different repositories, siloed in their home institutions, or lack the metadata required to enable their (re)use. 

The FAIR data principles were published in 2016 [@PMID:26978244]; FAIR stands for - F for Findable, A for Accessible, I for interoperable, R for Reusable. The FAIR Data Principles make data more valuable as it is easier to find through unique identifiers and easier to combine and integrate thanks to the formal shared knowledge representation. We can do this for training materials too by adapting the FAIR Data Principles to them.
