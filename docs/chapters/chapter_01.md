## Description

This chapter explains what the FAIR principles are, the importance of these principles and their increased adoption over the years, as well as the pros and cons of making training materials FAIR. We will give a brief history of FAIR data, and how these principles were extended and adapted to training materials. 

## Prerequisites

None 

## Keywords

FAIR, Open, findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable, reproducible, training, training materials, types of training materials, regulations, procedures, FAIR software 

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:

1. Minimum: Explain what FAIR means
2. Minimum: List the main pros and cons of FAIRifying training materials
3. Minimum: Determine whether a given type of training material can in principle be FAIRifyed
4. Recommended: Describe the difference between FAIR and Open
5. Recommended: Explain the difference between FAIRifying training materials vs FAIRifying data / software

## Learning experiences

LE (LO1 - Explain what FAIR means): 
. Lecture: Instructor provides a live lecture explaining the theory on FAIR, History, Open, etc - background. Alternative = video with the recorded lecture
. Quizz: with some key terms / points to assess if the learners have got them.

LE (LO2 - List main pros and cons of FAIRifying training materials): 
. Exercise - working in pairs: Ask the learners to provide a list of 3 pros and cons in a shared document.
. Formative assessment and Q&A: Instructor to discuss the shared document, and comment on the results described by the pairs.

LE (LO3 - Determine whether a given type of training material can in principle be FAIRifyed)
. Exercise - working in pairs: Each learner reflects on a set of training material they use to teach, and whether it is FAIRifiable given the LO1.

LE (LO4 - Describe the difference between FAIR and Open): 
. Lecture: Instructor provides a lecture explaining the differences between FAIR and Open (some links or material, provide the answer right away).

LE (LO5 - Explain the difference between FAIRifying training materials vs FAIRifying data / software):
. Provide the reading materials - papers about FAIRifying data / software, and let the learners bring the differences to the classroom and discuss.
