## Description

Making training material (re)usable for others, it is necessary to ensure its accessibility. Generally, the access of data and training material should be provided by using universally implementations and standardised communication protocols, with optional fully mechanised protocols. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection should (down)load the metadata without specialised tools. Therefore, a unique identifier and the choice of the repository where the training material is stored is a crucial factor (see chapter 5 and chapter 9).
Another important aspect in maximising reusability and making materials accessible is the definition of access rules. Since accessibility provides data retrieval, the access should be open and free for others. However, there are also cases where limitation is needed, e.g. sensitive data and according to those who have access to this private data. In the context of FAIR, training material does not have to be open exclusively. Even restricted data comply with the FAIR principles as long as accessibility requirements are defined properly.
Authentication and authorisation can help to limit the retrieval of training material. Restrictions can refer to a user account with user-specific rights, restricted domains (e.g., a university can give access to training material to their students), or paid options (content is only available for a fee). Also, different levels of access may be needed, e.g. training material is open but provides the collaboration between trainers by leaving e-mail contact when (re)using material. This contact protocol must be clear and explicit in the metadata.
At all points exact conditions and rules for the accessibility using clear and simple language should be provided.
