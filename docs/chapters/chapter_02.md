## Short description

Decision on the technical implementation of training materials and their educated use can make major contributions to deliver FAIR training materials. 
Examples are good structures that help contributors to edit, technical guides.

## 2.1 Long description
 * What are interoperable formats?

     * Examples of different file formats and what makes them interoperable

 * How will you ensure reproducibility / reusability of your materials by yourself and others?

    * Give a clear structure of your repository with folders and subfolders with a sounding (for you and others) 
         * Naming files, name conventions

     * README file (GitHub) / Master Doc (GDrive): a document describing and linking all different small pieces of materials in a certain order
Guidelines / recipe on how to re-use your materials (chapter 7?)

### Annotating your materials with an extensive narrative so that they can be used as stand-alone materials
There is an unresolvable question as to whether material should be self explanatory. 
For a presentation this would typically require very text heavy slides to capture all aspects of the subject on the slides.
It might make the slides also harder to reuse as different audiences might require more or less explanations for a given slide.
For lecture-style training materials it is probably better to place detailed content into a handbook or use text-book style reference materials and keep slides for lectures rather clean, only placing relevant elements directly on the slides.

The verbal presentation then can fill in the details. 

You can use the Notes panel in Powerpoint that essentially can take the complete transcript. 


     * Assign basic metadata (author, topic, target audience of the material) to allow the re-user  a basic understanding of the context (might overlap with chapter 5?)  - Briefly explain metadata and refer to [Chapters 5](chapter_05.md)

     * What if your materials are a single document (single slide deck / single tutorial / etc.)

     * How can others contribute - provide examples.


## 2.2 Prerequisites
[Chapters 1](chapter_01.md) and 2
