## Description
Metadata can be defined as data used to describe _other data_. That _other data_ is complete on its own even without the metadata; however, the metadata makes it easier, for instance, to quickly grasp what that _other data_ is about and to establish some common parameters that can be used to find and compare similar data, even if you have no access to that _other data_. This chapter will focus on explaining how to annotate training materials and events with rich metadata to improve their Findability, Interoperability, and Reusability.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this Chapter, learners will be able to:

1. Minimum, Understand - Explain the concept of metadata 

2. Minimum, Understand - Explain the relevance of metadata to FAIR Training Materials

3. Minimum, Remember - Identify metadata standards used in your communities/institutions to annotate training materials

4. Recommended, Apply - Describe their training materials with a metadata standard suitable for their domain/discipline (note: from the point of view of content, this could be a LE. bring your TrM, and structure/insert/compile the metadata)

5. Optional, Understand - Explain the concept of structured metadata
