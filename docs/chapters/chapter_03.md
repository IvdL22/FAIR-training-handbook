## Description
Here, we will describe a few platforms that can be used to host and share your materials in all four phases of their life cycle (development, delivery, sharing, and archiving), thus ensuring a higher degree of FAIRness. The platforms we will discuss are: Google Suite, GitHub and GitLab, Zenodo, Learning Management systems. We chose them as they are free, they include different features, and they are very commonly used in training. We will see which platforms are better to use in each phase of materials life cycle and why and what are the pros and cons of each platform according to FAIR principles.


## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to have done Chapter 1 & 2 and understand the need for FAIRifying their training materials and/or building their training materials FAIR from the beginning
From Chapter 2, be aware of what types of material they have or will have (lectures, exercises, video, datasets etc.). 

## Related chapters:
Chapter 1 & Chapter 2

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
- Describe the four phases of training materials life cycle (development, running course, sharing, archiving) 
- Describe how to use the Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) 
- List the (long-term) implications in terms of FAIR of choosing technologies such as Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS)
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases
- For each phase, explain how to interpret FAIR principles
- For each phase, identify platforms that best comply with the FAIR principles according to user’s needs and priorities
- Document/justify their choices for a given learning platform

 ## Learning Experiences
#### LO: Describe the four phases of training materials life cycle (development, running course, sharing, archiving) 
1. Lecture describing the four phases of training materials life cycle. 
```
Supporting materials:
- Narrative in the handbook
- Annotated slides for the delivery
```
2. (Tentative) Exercise: learners describe what they currently do with their materials in each of the four phases. 
```
Supporting materials:
```

#### LO: Describe how to use the Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) 
1. Brief narrative presenting the different platforms
```
Supporting materials:
```
2. Exercise: share in groups which ones you use / test quickly those you never used. 
```
Supporting materials:
```

#### LO: List the (long-term) implications in terms of FAIR of choosing technologies such as Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS)
1. Exercise: in groups, learners discuss what could be the implications in terms of FAIR of choosing technologies such as Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) and write the outcomes of their discussion in a shared document (the document will contain a table listing the technologies in the first column and empty cells in the second column for the implications).  
```
Supporting materials:
```
2. Learners compare their table with the table provided in the chapter, where some possible implications are provided. 

#### LO: Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases
1. Exercise: in groups, learners write  the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases in a shared Doc. They compare and discuss their results with the table “Pros & Cons” provided in the chapter.
```
Supporting materials:
```

#### LO: For each phase, explain how to interpret FAIR principles 
1. Narrative explaining the table structure and providing examples for each couple of dimensions
```
Supporting materials:
```
2. Exercise: Fill the Phases x FAIR table. 

#### LO: For each phase, identify platforms that best comply with the FAIR principles according to user’s needs and priorities
1. Brief narrative explaining why to focus on the user’s needs
```
Supporting materials:
```
2. Exercise: Highlight the more important columns of table 1.2 and 1.3 and fill those.
```
Supporting materials:
```

#### LO: Documenting/justifying their choices for a given learning platform
1. Exercise: justify the choice of one or multiple platforms.
