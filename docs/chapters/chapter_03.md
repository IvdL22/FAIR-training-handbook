## Description
Here, we will describe a few platforms that can be used to host and share your materials in all four phases of their life cycle (development, delivery, sharing, and archiving), thus ensuring a higher degree of FAIRness. The platforms we will discuss are: Google Suite, GitHub and GitLab, Zenodo, Learning Management systems. We chose them as they are free, they include different features, and they are very commonly used in training. We will see which platforms are better to use in each phase of materials life cycle and why and what are the pros and cons of each platform according to FAIR principles.

By the end of this chapter you will be able to:
- Describe the four phases of training materials life cycle (development, running course, sharing, archiving) 
- Describe how to use the Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS) 
- List the (long-term) implications in terms of FAIR of choosing technologies such as Google Suite, GitHub/GitLab, Zenodo, a web portal and a Learning Management System (LMS)
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the platforms in each of the four phases
- For each phase, explain how to interpret FAIR principles
- For each phase, identify platforms that best comply with the FAIR principles according to user’s needs and priorities
